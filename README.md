# Catenary Open Announcement Project

Trains sound cool too. More README details TBA, but for now it's a credits page. WMATA announcements were sourced from https://tris.fyi/wmata and defect detector files were provided to Catenary by Cole Thomsen aka BlowtorchHonor. Feel free to download, link, use these files for whatever.
