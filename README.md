# Catenary Open Announcement Project

A project to document and standardize the world's train and bus announcements. We request and collect announcements from different transit agencies, and record our own to fill in the gaps. Announcements are organized by region or agency, with sub-folders for each voice. For example, ``SanDiego/MTS`` would be the unidentified original Trolley voices, while ``SanDiego/SAM`` would be the announcements we've recorded originally. Additionally, the ``CATENARY`` folder contains the skeletons for announcements that you can plug different station names into.
