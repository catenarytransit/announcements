# Catenary Open Announcement Project

Trains sound cool too. More README details TBA, but for now it's a credits page. WMATA announcements were sourced from https://tris.fyi/wmata, defect detector files were provided to Catenary by Cole Thomsen aka BlowtorchHonor, and Sound Transit announcements were provided by quacksire with original files from Kevin Wallace's announcements at https://kevin.wallace.seattle.wa.us/foi/link-sounds/. Feel free to download, link, use these files for whatever.
